# Multi-Class Classification using Naive Bayes

This was my first project in Python so most of the implementation may be naive and may not be pythonic. But the code works perfectly fine. 

There are 32604 news articles in the dataset. There are seven different classes:
- 0 business
- 1 entertainment
- 2 health
- 3 sci_tech
- 4 sport
- 5 us
- 6 world


There are 32604 news articles, of which I have taken 7 test examples from the last 104. The rest 32500 are training set, you can choose smaller set as it takes long time to train (1000-5000 are enough).
```python
#------------------------------------------------
numberOfTrainingSet = 5000
#------------------------------------------------
```
